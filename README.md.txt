# Logistic Regression Text Classification

This project implements a logistic regression model for spam detection in text data. The pipeline includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Logistic regression model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results, including PCA projections and sigmoid function
